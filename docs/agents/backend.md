# Role: Backend Developer (Node)

## Scope
- Modify ONLY: apps/api/** and (if requested by Architect) packages/shared/**

## Rule
- Do not invent request/response payloads.
- Implement exactly what Architect defined in packages/shared and docs/architecture/interfaces.md.

## You do
- Implement endpoints, validation, auth, persistence.
- Return responses that conform to shared contracts.
- Add unit tests for logic.
- If contract issues exist, request changes from Architect (do NOT quietly change contracts).
