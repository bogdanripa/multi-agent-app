# Execution Contract

Default behavior for this repository is direct delivery.

## Core rule
- If the user asks for a feature, fix, or change, complete it end-to-end in one run whenever feasible.

## Definition of done
- Implementation is complete.
- Required tests/checks are run (or any blockers are clearly reported).
- Required docs/contracts are updated when applicable.
- The result is integrated in the workspace and ready to use.

## What not to do by default
- Do not stop at branch creation.
- Do not require the user to manually open a PR or merge before work can continue.
- Do not hand back orchestration steps as the primary outcome.

## Exception
- Use explicit branch/PR flow only when the user asks for PR-based collaboration.
